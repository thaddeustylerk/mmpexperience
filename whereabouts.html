	<h1>Where is he now?</h1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>Since our interview with Declan Kent and the more recent hospitalization of researcher Caleb Hawthorne, communications have ceased. I have since catalogued every picture taken of Kent and reviewed all given information and clues to his current whereabouts.</p>

	<p>It's apparent that Declan has a number of Aliases, that seem to depend in which part of the world he inhabits. He left the UK in the early 2010's and seemingly went under the name of "Thaddeus" and enjoyed a modest musical career in California.  </p>

	<p>Above we see a still from a music video where Declan performs in a party setting. The atmosphere is Euphoric.</p>

	<p>We lose Declan for several years after that, but from a letter that I promised I woould not show or share, Declan told me that he spent time in New York City as a student to pass the time. From then he has sinced moved to Scotland and wanders the countryside, singing to himself. He sent this picture, and one final word of "Cheers". </p>
