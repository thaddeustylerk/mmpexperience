	<p>Declan Nathaniel Kent is the the last and only confirmed Esper. He hails from "Windham", the birthplace of all of his kind, an Atlantis-like island documented in 1873 by local Dublin historian Colm O'Sullivan. </p>
	<br>
	<p>Declan is the only Esper known to have been (to his chagrin) outed. Declan appears identical to a human male in his late twenties' to early thirties. His appearance can be slightly altered memetically. Declan's real age is unknown, as the length of his life span in his words, is "flexible, like anyone's, but more than most". He declined to comment further. When asked for a rough birthdate, he replied that one of his earliest memories was that of meeting Queen Elizabeth II in her infancy. Delcan also confirmed that "Declan Nathaniel Kent" is one he chose, and he doesn't remember how to pronounce his given name.</p>
