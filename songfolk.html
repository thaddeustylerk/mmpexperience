	<p> Windham is said to be small, with the landmass of about 65% the size of Dublin. O'Sullvian explained in his book, "The Songfolk and the Dark Green Isle" that seclusion is only broken when one young male is sent out every ten years to see the world and report their findings. Declan has confirmed this, and did not answer when asked if this was his original purpose. When pressed further, Declan hinted that some of histories most prolific musical icons and pop/rock/rap stars were sometimes one of the Songfolk from Windham. Declan would not confirm, but smirked when names like Mozart and the Beatles were suggested.</p>

	<p> O'Sullivan explained that the Songfolk were indeed peculiar, but kind. He characterized them as "...ordinary people apart from their obsession with my foreign attributes and their otherwordly abilties". O'Sullivan described the town as simple politically, with a village head and lower officials. Perhaps the most interesting claim O'Sullivan made was the value placed in musical abilties paired with otherwordly talents. Every townsperson had some sort of musical talent and supernatural ability. He never explained this beyond mentioning that it was the framwork for the civlizations' competence hierarchy and basis for their religion, which he stated was "incredibly private". When asked about this, Declan replied, "Never talk religion, you're not allowed to believe what you want anymore. People are too [expletive] touchy."</p>
