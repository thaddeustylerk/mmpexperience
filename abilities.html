<p>Declan's abilities, were surprisingly the only aspect of himself and his history that he was willing to divulge freely. Below is the transcript from when Declan explained the extent of his abilities. </p>
<br>
<p><tt>
Hawthorne : Could you explain your... we'll call them "powers", can you explain them more?
<br>

Kent : (pause) Sure.
<br>
Kent : (drinks water, sets on table)
<br>
Kent : I've never said it out loud before. When I make up a melody, you know, when I write something? If I do it a certain way, and I sing it, it has sort of an affect on people.
<br>
Hawthorne : Could you be more specific?
<br>
Declan : All of us can sort of do this. Where I'm from, I mean. We can all do this when we sing, or play, or perform. Mine is a little more rare. When I play in front of a group, it's like I spill a vat of bottled luck. People are healed, people fall in love, people confess to crimes. It's different almost every time. I don't have much control over it. 
<br>
Hawthorne : (pause)
<br>
Hawthorne : You mentioned that you can alter your appearance. Could you elaborate?
<br>
Kent : It's not like that. I can't change how I look any more than you, beyond a haircut. But I can change how you see me. It won't make sense to you. But I can make myself muted, forgettable. I can also make myself unforgettable, but not in the way that you think. People don't like that one. 
<br>
Hawthorne : Could you show us the latter?
<br>
Kent :You sure?(pause)(a sound like metal wire stretching)
<br>
Hawthorne : (sharp breath)
<br>
Hawthorne : (looking down, but addressing Kent)Turn it off.
