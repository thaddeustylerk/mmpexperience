	<p>The Island of Windham is one of the lesser known legends sprouting from Celtic/English folklore. The Island is said to be home to one of the oldest cilizations in the UK, pre-dating the druids. The druids in fact, are said to be a soft bastardization of the "songfolk" practices and culture, as they are thought to be derived from Windham itself.</p>
	<br>

	 <p>In fact, the name "Windham" is a recent addition to the legend, as it was originally referred to as "Eilean Gan Ainm". "Windham" was coined when author/historian Colm O'Sullivan shipwrecked on the island, and after great care was taken to restore him to health from the townspeople, he affectionately named the island after "Wymondham Abbey", a Benedictine Parish that took him in when he was orphaned as a boy.  </p>
	 <br>
	 <p> Windham is impossible to reach through unconventional means. It appears that the seclusion is intentional, and enforced through unkown means.The only credible testimony of visiting the island is from O'Sullivan, who stated that "The island let me in. I couldn't explain how, and I don't know how I know. But it wasn't there one minute, and I was drowning, and the next, it rose out of the sea, like some gargantuan shadow, rising out of the depths, calling me to it."</p>
